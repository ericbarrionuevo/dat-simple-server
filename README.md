## dat simple server

Do you remember the time you'd drop a .php file into a ftp folder, and instantly, it was deployed?

**well, welcome to that again.**

This is a POC on how we can handle such a quick delivery, perfect for small projects, lonely webservices and all kind of small uses.

### TODO
- [x] have a working POC
- [ ] basic documentation
- [ ] documentation for integration with nginx/apache
- [x] add TS flavor
- [x] deploy to npm
